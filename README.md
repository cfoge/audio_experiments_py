Some experiments with audio in python

Note Detector:
This Python script analyzes an audio file, detects musical notes, and splits the audio into separate files named after each detected note. Each split occurs at zero crossings for clean audio segments.

audio mosaic:
This Python script takes an audio file and attempts to recreate it using snippets from another audio file.
